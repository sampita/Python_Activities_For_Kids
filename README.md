# Python_Activities_For_Kids

## Practice: Activities for Kids
Define four Python functions named `run`, `swing`, `slide`, and `hide_and_seek`. Each function should take a child's name as an argument. Each function should print that the child performed the activity.

For example, `Jay ran like a fool!` or `Chantelle slid down the slide!.`

The following lists of children should be iterated, and the names sent to the appropriate functions.

```
running_kids = ["Pam", "Sam", "Andrea", "Will"]
swinging_kids = ["Marybeth", "Jenna", "Kevin", "Courtney"]
sliding_kids = ["Mike", "Jack", "Jennifer", "Earl"]
hiding_kids = ["Henry", "Heather", "Hayley", "Hugh"]
